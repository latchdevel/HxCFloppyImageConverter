<h1>
Common File Formats for Emulated TRS-80 Floppy Disks</h1>

<br>Last revised 4 Jul 2008

<p>Most current TRS-80 Model I/III/4 emulators use one of three common
file formats for emulated floppy disk media. The extension .DSK is
usually used for all three formats, and some emulators transparently
support two or three of them, while others support only one. The two
most common formats both originated with emulators written by Jeff
Vavasour, while the third originated with an emulator written by David Keil, 
so I'll take the liberty of giving the formats names that use their initials.

</p><ul>
<li>The JV1 format originated in Jeff's Model I emulator for MS-DOS. It's
a very simple, limited format that can represent only single-density media
with 256 byte sectors and a Model I directory on track 17.<p>

</p></li><li>The JV3 format originated in Jeff's Model III/4 emulator for MS-DOS.
It is much more flexible than JV1, but still cannot represent everything
the real hardware can do, so some copy-protected disks cannot be represented.
The format has been extended to support 8-inch floppies and sector sizes of
other than 256 bytes, but not all emulators support these extensions. I
indicate below which features are extensions and which emulators are known
to support which extensions.<p>

</p></li><li>The DMK format originated in David's Model III/4 emulator for Windows.
Unlike JV1 and JV3, DMK is able
to represent essentially everything that a real TRS-80 floppy disk
controller could do, including copy protected TRS-80 disks.
</li></ul>

<p>This document describes the JV1 and JV3 formats in complete detail and
indicates (where known) which emulators support which.  
DMK is quite different from JV1 and JV3 and is not described
in this document, but there is
<a href="http://discover-net.net/%7Edmkeil/trs80/trstech.htm#Technical-DMK-disks">a description on David Keil's Web page</a>.
You probably
don't need any of this information unless you are writing an emulator
or working with unusual disks.

</p><h2>
The JV1 Format</h2>
The JV1 format is simply an array of 256-byte sectors stored in a file.
Byte 0 of the file is byte 0 of track 0, sector 0; byte 256 is byte 0 of
track 0, sector 1, and so forth. There are 10 sectors per track (i.e.,
single density), numbered 0 through 9, and only one side. Tracks are numbered
starting at 0. All sectors on track 17 are formatted with the nonstandard
data address mark 0xFA, indicating a TRSDOS 2.3 directory. All other sectors
are formatted with the standard data address mark 0xFB.

<p>Note: In emulations of the WD1791/3 floppy disk controller used in the
Model III and 4, it is best to present track 17 as being formatted with
the standard deleted data address mark 0xF8. The WD1791/3 cannot write
0xFA, and upon reading, returns it as 0xFB. So Model III/4 operating systems
use 0xF8 on the directory track instead.
</p><h2>
The JV3 Format</h2>
The JV3 format consists of a fixed-size array of <i>sector headers</i>,
followed by an area containing the data for each sector. As an extension
to allow for more sectors, a second block of sector headers and data can
follow. Here is the format in pseudo-C notation. The length of each data
area depends on the content of the headers, as described below.
<pre>typedef struct {
&nbsp; SectorHeader headers1[2901];
&nbsp; unsigned char writeprot;
&nbsp; unsigned char data1[];
&nbsp; SectorHeader headers2[2901];
&nbsp; unsigned char padding;
&nbsp; unsigned char data2[];
} JV3;</pre>

<h3>
Write Protect and Padding</h3>
The field <i>writeprot</i> should normally contain 0xFF. As an extension,
a value of 0x00 in his field indicates that the disk is write-protected
(i.e., it is not writable).

<p>The field <i>padding</i> is currently unused. It should contain 0xFF.
</p><h3>
The Sector Header</h3>
Each sector in a JV3 file is described by a three-byte header. The first
byte gives the sector's track number, the second gives its sector number
on the track, and the third is a set of flags.
<pre>typedef struct {
&nbsp; unsigned char track;
&nbsp; unsigned char sector;
&nbsp; unsigned char flags;
} SectorHeader;

#define JV3_DENSITY     0x80  /* 1=dden, 0=sden */
#define JV3_DAM         0x60  /* data address mark code; see below */
#define JV3_SIDE        0x10  /* 0=side 0, 1=side 1 */
#define JV3_ERROR       0x08  /* 0=ok, 1=CRC error */
#define JV3_NONIBM      0x04  /* 0=normal, 1=short */
#define JV3_SIZE        0x03  /* in used sectors: 0=256,1=128,2=1024,3=512
                                 in free sectors: 0=512,1=1024,2=128,3=256 */

#define JV3_FREE        0xFF  /* in track and sector fields of free sectors */
#define JV3_FREEF       0xFC  /* in flags field, or'd with size code */
</pre>

<p>The <i>track</i> field gives both the physical track number on which the
sector lies and the logical track number that is formatted in the sector's
ID. Numbering starts from 0. Thus it is not possible to represent a copy-protected
disk where sectors were deliberately formatted with incorrect track numbers.
The format allows for 255 tracks (numbered 0 through 0xFE), but emulators
may impose lower limits. You can expect at least 80 tracks to be supported;
xtrs currently allows up to 96.

</p><p>The <i>sector</i> field gives the logical sector number that is formatted
into the sector's ID field. The physical order of sectors on the track
is not explicitly represented, but xtrs (and perhaps other emulators) present
them in the order they are recorded in the JV3 file; thus when a TRS-80
program formats a track with interleave and reads back the sector ids,
they come back in the same interleaved order.

</p><p>The <i>flags</i> field packs in a lot of information:
</p><ul>
<li>
If JV3_DENSITY is set, the sector was formatted in double density (MFM);
if not, it was formatted in single density (FM).<p>

</p></li><li>
The 2-bit JV3_DAM field encodes the sector's data address mark.  Here are
the basic meanings of the codes:

<table nosave="" border="1" width="90%" cols="3">
<tbody><tr>
<td>JV3_DAM value</td>
<td>Single density</td>
<td>Double density</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0x00</td>
<td>0xFB (Normal)</td>
<td>0xFB (Normal)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0x20</td>
<td>0xFA (User-defined)</td>
<td>0xF8 (Deleted)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0x40</td>

<td>Invalid; unused</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0x60</td>
<td>0xF8 (Deleted)</td>
<td>Invalid; unused</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The treatment of single density data address marks by the Western
Digital 1771 and 179x controllers used in original TRS-80 hardware is
rather inconvenient.  The WD1771 (used in the TRS-80 Model I) is capable
of writing any of the four DAMs shown above, and can distinguish
amongst all four on reading.  The WD179x (used in the Model III and 4),
however, can write only 0xFB or 0xF8, and on reading, it cannot
distinguish between 0xFB and 0xFA, or between 0xF8 and 0xF9.

</p><p>TRS-80 operating systems differentiate directory sectors from
ordinary data sectors by giving them different data address marks.
Unfortunately, Model I TRSDOS uses 0xFA on directory sectors, which a
WD179x cannot write and cannot distinguish from the 0xFB used on data
sectors.  Other Model I operating systems (such as LDOS) typically
write 0xF8 on directory sectors but accept either 0xFA or 0xF8 when
reading them, allowing them to read TRSDOS disks.  Compatibility
problems remain when attempting to use Model I TRSDOS disks on
a Model III or 4, and when attempting to use LDOS disks with Model I
TRSDOS.

</p><p>An emulator can easily paper over these compatibility problems by
behaving differently from the real hardware.  All currently known
emulators do so, making (at least) the following changes to strictly
correct behavior: (1) If TRS-80 software attempts to write or format a
0xF8 DAM in single density, it is instead recorded in the JV3 header
as 0xFA.  (2) If TRS-80 software reads a single density sector that
has the 0xFA DAM using an emulated WD179x, it is returned as 0xF8
instead.  These changes hide all the DOS compatibility problems
described in the previous paragraph.

</p><p>It might be worthwhile to make precisely correct behavior available
as a run-time emulator option, as this might allow more types of
"protected" self-booting TRS-80 disks to work correctly.  This option
is available in xtrs version 3.2 and later, but not in any other known
emulators.

</p><p>The following tables summarize the DAM behavior of
both the WD1771 and the WD179x.  On the WD1771, read status bits 6,5 are
used to report the DAM of the sector just read, while write command
bits 1,0 select the DAM to write; on the WD179x, only read status bit 5
and write command bit 0 are significant: read status bit 6 is always
0, while write command bit 1 is used for a function unrelated to DAM
selection.  The behavior of these bits on the actual hardware is shown
first in each cell; the modifications typically made by emulators
follow in parentheses.  It should be emphasized that WD1771 behavior
shown here correctly describes the actual hardware, even though it
contradicts the Western Digital data sheet; the data sheet erroneously
transposes the column headings for status bits 6 and 5.  As an aside,
it seems likely that the engineers who designed the WD179x were misled
by this error, as the value that the WD179x returns in bit 5 is the
value that the WD1771 was documented as returning in bit 5, but that it
actually returns in bit 6.

JV3_SIDE reflects both the physical side on which the sector is recorded
and the side number formatted in the sector's ID. Thus it is not possible
to represent a copy-protected disk where sectors were formatted with incorrect
side numbers or with values other than 0 or 1 in the sector ID's 8-bit
side field.<p>

</p></li><li>
JV3_ERROR, if set, indicates that the sector should show a data CRC error
when read. The actual value of the two CRC bytes is not represented.<p>

</p></li><li>
JV3_NONIBM is an xtrs-specific extension that partially supports the WD1771's
feature of "non-IBM" sector sizes. Only a small subset of the functionality
is supported, with some special kludges specifically to make the VTOS 3.0
copy protection scheme work. It is probably best to treat this bit as a
"must be zero" field in other emulators; see the xtrs source code if
you are really sure you want to know how it works, and keep your barf bag
handy.<p>

</p></li><li>
JV3_SIZE is an extension to support sector sizes of other than 256 bytes.
This field is encoded differently depending on whether the sector
is in use or free (not in use):

<p><table nosave="" border="1" width="90%" cols="4">
<tbody><tr>
<td>Size</td>
<td>IBM size code in sector ID</td>
<td>JV3_SIZE field value if in use</td>
<td>JV3_SIZE field value if free</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>00</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>256</td>
<td>01</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>512</td>
<td>02</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1024</td>
<td>03</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

</p><p>Thus, if a sector is in use, xor'ing its JV3_SIZE field with 1
gives the IBM size code that appears in its sector ID size field.
If a sector is free, xor'ing its JV3_SIZE field with 2 gives its IBM
size code.  This representation
was chosen because the original JV3 format supports only 256-byte sectors,
always places zeros in the JV3_SIZE field for sectors that are in use,
and always places ones in the field for sectors that are free.
</p></li></ul>

<p>If a sector header is not in use (free), its track and sector fields
must contain 0xFF. Its flags field must contain 0xFC plus the
appropriate free JV3_SIZE field value given above.

</p><h3>
The Data Blocks</h3>
For each sector header, there is one data block. The blocks are placed
in the same order as the headers that describe them, and are tightly packed.
Thus to find the data block for the <i>n</i>th header, you need to know
the total size of data blocks 0 to <i>n </i>- 1. A sector header marked
as free <i>does</i> have a corresponding data block, of the size indicated
in its size field. However, the file can (and in fact should; see below)
end immediately after the last in-use data block.
<h3>
The Second Header Block</h3>
The second header block is present if and only if the file is long enough
to contain it. It starts immediately after the last data block described
by the first header block. Thus to find the second header block, you need
to know the total size of all data blocks described by the first header
block.

<p>It's obvious, by the way, how to extend the format to more than two
header blocks, but no known emulators support more than two. Having more
than two is not useful to describe any floppy format that was supported
by any real TRS-80. One block is sufficient for 5.25-inch DD drives,
and two are sufficient for 8-inch drives, 5.25-inch HD drives,
or 3.5-inch HD drives.
</p><h3>
Allocating and Freeing Sectors</h3>
Allocating and freeing sectors is a little tricky (if you support the extension
to sizes other than 256 bytes). When a new emulated disk is first created,
it should have one header block, filled with free 256-byte sectors. When
a new sector is formatted, if a free sector of the correct size exists,
it can be reused; otherwise, the next sector after the highest in-use sector
can be chosen and changed to the correct size. In the latter case, since
there is no data after the sector that is being resized, resizing it does
not require anything to move. When a sector is erased (because the track
it is on is being reformatted), it should normally be freed without changing
its size, so that the data of later sectors need not be moved.

<p>If the highest in-use sector is freed, the emulator should search backward
for the new highest in-use sector, and should truncate the file to eliminate
any sector data for trailing free sectors, as well as the second header
block if it is no longer needed. Why do this? If the user reformats
some sectors to be shorter or longer than they used to be, the nominal
start of the second header block (as defined above) will shift. If you
have garbage at the end of the file, and the block shifts to start somewhere
in the garbage, then when you read the file back in again later, you'll
have a second header block full of garbage that will confuse you.
</p><h2>
Support</h2>
Here is a summary of which emulators support which formats and which features.
The data is believed current as of this document's revision
date. Future versions of some of
these emulators may support more (or fewer!) features. If an emulator does
not support a feature, it will still work with disks created by emulators
that do support the feature, as long as those disks didn't require that
feature when they were created. For example, an emulator that supports
the second header block will not create a second header block unless you
format more that 2901 sectors on one disk; note that an 80 track, double
sided, double density 5.25-inch disk contains less than 2901 sectors.
